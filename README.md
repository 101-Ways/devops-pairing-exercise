DevOps Pairing Exercise
=======================

# Goal

Automate the creation of a web server, and a script to check the server is up.

# Prerequisites

Use the AWS account credentials provided.

# The Task

You are required to set up a new server in AWS. It must:

* Be publicly accessible.
* Run Nginx.
* Serve a `/version.txt` file, containing only static text representing a version number, for example:

```
1.0.6
```

# Mandatory Work

Fork this repository.

* Provide instructions on how to create the server.
* Use a configuration management tool (such as Puppet, Chef or Ansible) to bootstrap the server.
* Provide a script that can be run periodically (and externally) to check if the server is up and serving the expected version number. 
* Alter the README to contain the steps required to:
  * Create the server.
  * Run the health check script.

Give user `aeells|schmiegelow` access to your fork. 
Feel free to ask questions as you go if anything is unclear, confusing, or just plain missing.

# Extra Credit

This exercise is timeboxed, but if any of these shortcut the process by making it easier in the long-run they might be worth considering up front. We won't mark you down for not doing the extra credits, but if you want to give them a go...

* Put the server behind a load balancer.
* Run Nginx inside a Docker container.
* Make the checker script SSH into the instance, check if Nginx is running and start it if it isn't.

# Questions

#### What scripting languages can I use?

Any you like. Youâ€™ll have to justify your decision. We use Bash, Python, Groovy and JavaScript internally. Please pick something you're familiar with, as you'll need to be able to discuss it.

#### What will you be grading me on?

Scripting skills, elegance, understanding of the technologies you use, security, documentation.

#### Will I have a chance to explain my choices?

Hopefully this will emerge as we pair and converse. 
But feel free to comment your code, or put explanations in a pull request within the repo.
